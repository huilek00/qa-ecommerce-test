## ðŸš€ Getting Started


### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Chrome browser (latest version)
- Git for version control


### Installation


1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qa-ecommerce-test.git
   cd qa-ecommerce-test


2. **Create virtual environment** (recommended)
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


3. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
### Running Tests


#### Individual Test Execution
```bash
# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_login.py -v


# Run API tests
python -m pytest tests/api/test_api_products.py -v


# Run with HTML report
python -m pytest tests/test_cart.py --html=reports/cart_test_report.html --self-contained-html
```
#### Run all tests
```bash
# Run all tests with detailed reporting
pytest --html=reports/report.html --self-contained-html
```


#### Using unittest (alternative)
```bash
# Run individual test
python tests/test_cart.py


# Run all tests in a directory
python -m unittest discover tests/ -v
```


## ðŸ“Š Test Reports & Screenshots


### HTML Test Report
After running the test suite, a detailed **HTML report** is generated, showing the status of each test case, execution time, and any error details.


### How to Open the HTML Report
Once the tests have finished running and the HTML report has been generated, you can open it in your browser to review the results.


**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the `reports` folder in your project directory.
2. Locate the file: `report.html`
3. Double-click the file, or open it using your preferred browser:
- **Windows**: Right-click â†’ Open with â†’ Select browser
- **Mac/Linux**: `open reports/report.html` or `xdg-open reports/report.html` from terminal


### HTML Report Screenshot
Below is the HTML test report generated after running the full test suite.


This report shows:
- **31 total test cases executed**
- **All tests passed** âœ… (0 failed)
- **10 UI tests** covering login, registration, product search, cart, checkout, and contact form functionalities
- **21 API tests** covering product management, user account management, order management, and API validation

| Category  | Test Cases | Passed | Failed | Pass Rate |
| --------- | ---------- | ------ | ------ | --------- |
| UI Tests  | 10         | 10     | 0      | 100%      |
| API Tests | 21         | 21     | 0      | 100%      |
| **Total** | **31**     | **31** | **0**  | **100%**  |




### ðŸ“¸ Example: Screenshot-on-Failure
To demonstrate the **automatic screenshot capture** feature, I created a temporary **fake fail test** in `tests/test_login.py`.  
This test intentionally fails, which triggers the screenshot hook and saves the image to: `reports/screenshots/`




#### The command I executed to produce the fake test failure
```bash
pytest tests/test_login.py --html=reports/report_fail_test.html --self-contained-html -v
```


This will generate:


- **`reports/report_fail_test.html`** â†’ HTML report showing the failed test  
- **`reports/screenshots/PYTEST_FAILURE_<test_name>_<timestamp>.png`** â†’ Automatically captured screenshot at the moment of failure  


---


### ðŸ“¸ Example of Failure Report & Screenshot
Below is the example of:
1. **Screenshot of `report_fail_test.html`** generated after running the fake failed test.
2. **Screenshot file** (`FAILURE_LoginTest_test_force_fail_example_20250812_124930.png`) which was automatically generated when the test failed.


#### HTML Report with Failure
